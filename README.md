OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:IMAGE RECOGNITION USING OPENCV

Image Recognition in Python using OpenCV. Face Detection is done using Haar Cascade, and Recognition is done using the Linear Binary Pattern Histogram Algorithm. For more details, refer this and this

####How to Use

 git clone https://github.com/sarthakagarwal18/Image-Recognition.git
 python Face_Recog.py test.jpg


Note: The Recognition is done through numerical labels. For example: 2 corresponds to Leonardo DiCaprio. Also, since the training dataset considered here is very small, the recognition can be inaccurate. Adding more training images will increase the accuracy.

Inspired from thisÂ repository.
